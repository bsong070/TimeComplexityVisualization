### [TimeComplexityVisualization](https://bsong070.github.io/TimeComplexityVisualization/)

I made this project to help visualize the differences between time complexities since Big O was a new concept to me. There are four different methods consisting of: O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), and O(n ^ 2).

All methods share the same time delay and can be easily modified by changing the "SPEED" variable.

NOTE: Since O(log n) assumes an array is already sorted, clicking on it will automatically sort the array but the time delay is only set for the O(log n) operation. Since O(log n) is extremely fast, you may need to increase "SPEED" to actually see it in action since it will happen instantaneously.
